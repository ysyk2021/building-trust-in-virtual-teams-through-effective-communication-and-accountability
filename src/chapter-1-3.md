Introduction: Brief History of Remote Work and Trust
====================================================

Remote work has been around for centuries, with examples of people working from home or outside of traditional offices dating back to ancient Rome. However, it wasn't until the rise of technology in the 20th century that remote work became a viable option for many workers.

With the advent of the internet and communication technologies such as email and video conferencing, remote work has become increasingly common in today's globalized workplace. This has led to the rise of virtual teams, where team members may be located in different cities, countries, or even continents.

One of the biggest challenges facing virtual teams is building trust among team members. When team members are physically separated, it can be difficult to establish strong relationships and develop trust. However, with effective communication and accountability, virtual teams can overcome these challenges and build a culture of trust and collaboration.

In this book, we will explore strategies for building trust in virtual teams through effective communication and accountability. We will discuss the unique challenges that virtual teams face, and provide practical solutions for overcoming them. By implementing these strategies, virtual teams can achieve their goals and succeed in today's fast-paced, ever-changing environment.
