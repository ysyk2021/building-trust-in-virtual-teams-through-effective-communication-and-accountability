Trust in virtual teams refers to the belief that team members will act with integrity, competence, and accountability. It involves having confidence in the reliability and capability of other team members, as well as a belief in their intentions and motivations.

In virtual teams, trust is built on effective communication, shared goals and objectives, and a sense of mutual respect and responsibility. When team members trust one another, they are more likely to work together effectively, communicate openly, and take risks.
